    "To optimize a construction schedule using an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with T5-small for question-answering without using a knowledge graph, we can focus on integrating document retrieval directly with the T5 model. This involves leveraging documents that contain relevant information about the construction tasks, dependencies, resources, and other critical factors.\n",
