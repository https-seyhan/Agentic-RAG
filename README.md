 Implementing a basic Agentic RAG:

    Document Corpus: A set of documents to retrieve information from.
    Retrieval Mechanism: A simple function to find relevant documents.
    Text Generation: Using GPT-3.5 (or another available model) to generate responses based on retrieved information.
    Agentic Behavior: A mechanism to decide when to retrieve information and when to generate responses directly.

Creating an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) code involves several key steps, including setting up a retrieval system, integrating it with a generative model, and creating an agentic framework that enables the system to take actions based on the retrieved and generated content
